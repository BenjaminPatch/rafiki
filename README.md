### Getting Started
##### Prerequisites
To run this program on a unix system, you must have gcc (or some other valid compiler). If you are using a compiler other than gcc, you will need to set up the compilation process accordingly.
##### Installing/Compiling
The Makefile in /src outlines which files should be compiled then linked to other object files. Running the "make" command should be valid for most unix systems, provided gcc is installed. This project was made on Ubuntu and compiles with the provided makefile on that.
